# asteroids.v2
asteroids Game made with Javascript by @onishiweb . 
i wanted to have a look at the code .  then i just saw the colors are not fun, ship size was big . 
I colored it up , made the ship smaller . 
I might probablly update the code more if i had any free time . 
maybe change the asteroids into Space Monsters?
